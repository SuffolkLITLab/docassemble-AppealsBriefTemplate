  AlExhibitDocument - containter for everything 
  ALExhibitList - container for all documents (each category has a list, make it more natural for gathering) 
  we will create our own AlExhibit list for each group of motions, orders, docket sheet, that is uploaded and mergeinto the ALExhibitDocument 
  ALExhibit - Document that gets a mention in the table of contents 
  - each page is its own object underneath it
